## Proposal


### Domain Background

Around 2 years back, I participated in my company Hackathon where I worked on the **sentiment** and **intent** analysis for a chat application.
I had used Stanford NLP library but during the contest, I could only scratch the surface of NLP. And then again, around an year back I explored **sentiment analysis** on the tweets; but again couldn't make much progress. 

But, that gave me motivation to explore the field further and that's one of the prime reason for me to do this course. I really wanted to decode the science behind such interesting problems.
