## Proposal


### Domain Background

Around 2 years back, I participated in my company Hackathon where I worked on the **sentiment** and **intent** analysis for a chat application.
I had used Stanford NLP library but during the contest, I could only scratch the surface of NLP. And then again, around an year back I explored **sentiment analysis** on the tweets; but again couldn't make much progress. In either cases I couldn't understand the field much, but it gave me motivation to explore the field further and that's one of the prime reason for me to do this course.

**Sentiment Analysis** is one of the most interesting domain of machine learning. I am planning to use this oportunity to explore this field. 

### Problem Statement

**Perform movie review using machine learning techniquies.** On internet a lot of content is available which gives review or feedback of movies. Now, for a person to decide whether to go for a movie or not is not so trivial if he/she has to go through 
countless tweets, facebook posts/comments and IMDB reviews. 

Machine learning can play a big role in churning out all these data from diverse sources and just providing an overall positive or negative feedback of the movies i.e. in short weather it's thumbs up or down. Machine learning can also help to classify a movie in more than two categories like average, good, very good, bad etc. As a user it will be really helpful to just know the overall feedback of the movie rather than going through the countless reviews. 

**For this capstore project, I will be using IMDB dataset and perform sentimet analysis.**
