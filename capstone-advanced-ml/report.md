## Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes classifier uses the Bayes Theorem to select the outcome with the highest probability. This classifier assumes 
the features(in this case the words) are independent and hence the word naive.

The Naive Bayes classifier for this problem says that the probability of the label (positive or negative) for the given review
text is equal to the probability of the text given the label, times the probability a label occurs, everything divided by 
the probability that this text is found.
